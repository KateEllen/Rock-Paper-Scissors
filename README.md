Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. You can test yourself against the computer, while keeping track of your score. There's even a rules section, so if you've never played before now is the perfect oppertunity!

## Features

#### Made user input easier by:
- Case insensitivity can enter r, R or Rock etc. 
- Leading/trailing space stripping.
- Users don't have to type entire letters for Yes No validation, but keeping it simple.
- Skip user name and default to PLAYER 1 if then donâ€™t enter anything.

#### Made User input consistent so user knows what is expect of them:
- Output r: rock etc. 

### Future Features 
#### Google sheets to collect usernames and show 'Most Addicted Players'
- This feature would collect usernames and compare them to a google doc, user's could then view what user has played the most. 
- This feature would also show their wins and losses. 
- Due to time restriction this could not be added to this version.
